# 📡 Check Internet Up (chkinetup) ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v0.09-blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

**Check Internet Up** (`chkinetup`) is a lightweight Linux internet connectivity monitor, ideal for Raspberry Pi, home automation, and remote-access systems. It regularly checks connectivity and logs outages, helping diagnose Wi-Fi drops, router failures, or ISP issues.

## ✨ Features
- Runs on Raspberry Pi, Linux, and Windows
- Detects Internet connectivity loss quickly
- Logs failures and restorations with timestamps
- Lightweight — suitable for background service use
- No dependencies beyond standard tools

## 🔍 How Connectivity Is Checked (No Ping Required)

`chkinetup` does **not** use ICMP ping.  
Instead, it performs a **real TCP connection attempt** to each configured host on **port 443** (HTTPS). This method checks more meaningful, real-world connectivity.

### ✅ Why TCP Port 443?
- HTTPS (443) is almost always allowed through firewalls
- Confirms **DNS resolution + route availability + service responsiveness**
- Detects real connectivity outages that a ping may **miss**

### ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified)
For each host, every `N` seconds:
1. Resolve its IP using `getaddrinfo()`
2. Attempt a **non-blocking** TCP socket connection
3. Wait briefly using `select()` (timeout)
4. Treat it as:
   - ✅ *Up* if the TCP handshake succeeds
   - ❌ *Unreachable* if it fails or times out

### 🧠 Why This Matters
Unlike ping:
- Doesn’t rely on ICMP (often blocked)
- Tests real internet usability
- More accurate for detecting failures that impact web browsing, streaming, VPN, etc.

> In short: If `chkinetup` says your internet is down…  
> your apps will **definitely** feel it too. ✅

## ⏱️ Scheduling
Run automatically via cron (example):
```bash
crontab -e
```
Add:
```cron
# Check internet at reboot
@reboot /home/pi/sbin/chkinetup 5 -l ~/log/chkinetup.log
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
Default hosts monitored:
- www.google.com  
- www.cloudflare.com  
- www.microsoft.com  
- www.amazon.com  
You can change the target hosts or interval at the top of the script to suit your network.
